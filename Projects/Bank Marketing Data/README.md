Project Details:

The objective of the project is to apply various different classification models using R.
The classification goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe (yes or no).

Dataset Details:

The Bank Marketing Data Set is a summary of the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The data we are using is a modified version of the original dataset, which is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

Solution Summary:

1. We took a random sample of 1000 observations from the original dataset
2. Explored the data, did some pre-processing, preliminary analysis, completed and cleaned the data.
3. Divided the data into 70% training and 30% test set
4. Created classification models using the following techniques:
  - Decision Tree
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Bagging
  - Boosting
  - Random Forest
5. Classified each test case as subscribed: yes/no
6. Did comparative analysis of the models and reported the accuracy of each model
7. Calculated the confidence of each model and plotted ROC curves for all models
8. Improved on one of the existing classifiers and determined which model was the best classifier.
9. Documented the results and analysis into a report.

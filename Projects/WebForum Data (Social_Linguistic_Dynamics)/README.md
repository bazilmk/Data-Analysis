There is a theory in social science, that people adopt similar patterns of language use when they interact.
We are investigating whether this concept is evident for an online forum, where participants communicate with each other via conversations in a thread.  

Key points we are looking out for:

1. Whether members who are communicating directly with eachother (via threads) use similar language, which may be different to other members of the forum.
2. Whether the language used changes over time. For example, does the proportion of language expressing optimism change?

Web Forum dataset details:
1. Consists of the metadata and linguistic analysis of 20,000 posts over the years 2002 to 2011.

The linguistic analysis was conducted using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), which assesses the prevalence of certain thoughts, feelings and motivations by determining the proportion of key words in language.
